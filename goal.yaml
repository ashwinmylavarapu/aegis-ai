  5. **CRITICAL**: Now, for each of the post selectors you found in the previous step, execute the `get_post_details` tool one time.
  6. After you have called `get_post_details` for all posts, you MUST stop calling tools.
  7. Your final step is to review the entire history of extracted details from all the posts.
  8. Call `finish_task` with a JSON summary of the posts you found. If none were found, state that in the final summary.
