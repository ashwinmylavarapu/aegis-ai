  # PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION
  1. Navigate to www.linkedin.com.
  2. Scroll down 5 times to load initial content.
  3. Find the "show more feed updates" button and click it 5 times, scrolling 3 times after each click.
  4. Use the `find_elements` tool to get a list of unique selectors for up to 50 post containers (selector: 'div.feed-shared-update-v2').

  # PHASE 2: ITERATION & FINAL ANALYSIS
  5. **CRITICAL**: Now, for each of the 50 post selectors you found in the previous step, execute the `get_post_details` tool one time.
  6. After you have called `get_post_details` for all 50 posts, you MUST stop calling tools.
  7. Your final step is to review the entire history of extracted details from all the posts. Analyze this complete dataset to find any posts where the author is "Aakash Gupta".
  8. Call `finish_task` with a JSON summary of the posts you found. If none were found, state that in the final summary.
